## Today I Learned (TIL)

### About

This space serves as a personal knowledge base where I keep concise write-ups of small things I learn day to day across various technologies, techniques, tools, and any miscellaneous bits of knowledge. The goal of this repository is to document my continuing education and serve as a point of reference for others who might find these tidbits useful.
